## Hi there! I'm Charlotte Hulseman

### I'm a Software Engineer and UX Designer

- I recently graduated from the University of Washington's Full Stack Development bootcamp, and am seeking an opportunity to contribute to an impactful product and a diverse, dynamic team.
- I have a strong work ethic and an empathetic, user-centric eye for design, which comes to my aide when coding. 
- I live in NYC with my Siberian Husky named Panda, and love to get outside and be active.
